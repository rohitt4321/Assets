                        <p>It is generally felt that there is a wide gap between education and industry requirements.
                            Students often complain that they are not properly prepared for the workplace after
                            completing their studies. </p>
                        <p>In order to bridge this gap, it is important for educators to understand the needs of
                            industry and align their syllabi accordingly. Only then can students be adequately prepared
                            for the challenges they will face in the real world. </p>
                        <p>Some key areas that should be addressed in the syllabus are: - <strong>Communication
                                skills</strong> - <strong>Teamwork</strong> - <strong>Problem solving</strong> -
                            <strong>Critical thinking</strong> - <strong>Time management</strong> - <strong>Conflict
                                resolution</strong> - <strong>Interpersonal skills</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>All the mentionded skills are developed in students with many scientifically designed
                            workshops and events and students are guided and graded in their certication as per their
                            efforts in the activities</p>
